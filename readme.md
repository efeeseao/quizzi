### The challenge

My app allows users to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- Change the app's theme between light and dark

### Continued development

I greatly enjoyed working on this project, and it was my first time using gitflow. I found the organizational structure it provides quite appealing; I felt more confident developing my branches with specific goals. It's definitely an approach I want to invest more time in to enhance my skills and gain a deeper understanding of using gitflow correctly.

Regarding the project itself, I am pleased with the outcome. Although not an overly complex app, the experience was incredibly rewarding and beneficial. It provided me with the opportunity to revisit Next.js concepts I hadn't practiced in a while, contributing significantly to my professional growth.
